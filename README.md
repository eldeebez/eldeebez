- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abdulrhman Eldeeb and I study applied computer science in my second year.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer networks, databases and software engineering. But I am a person who is eager to learn and passionate about my field of study so I am always ready to take steps in other specialities other than the ones i am interested in.
